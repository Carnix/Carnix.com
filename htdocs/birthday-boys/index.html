					<h1>The Birthday Boys</h1>

					<p>Also known as "2 guys, a bass, a keyboard, enough talent to be willing to record (but not much more than that), a tape recorder (actually a 4-track, I think on some of them) and enough patience to give each song exactly one take."</p>

					<p>A few notes.  These tracks were taken from audio tapes originally recorded while I was in high school in the early 1990s under less than optimal conditions.  Then, for about 20 years they lived in a big rubbermade container in my basement until August 25th 2013 when I found an old walkman I "borrowed" from my friend (Matt Julich) somewhere around 1998 (never returned) and realized I actually had the equipment to record these to digital format.</p>

					<p>This is the result, for what it's worth</p>

					<p>I'm not an audio tech, I just used Windows Sound Recorder and the Mic input to record them, so the recordings aren't very good.  Seems to  me, though, that's doing justice to the generally shoddy quality of the originals.  The only techy thing I did was to convert the.mp3 formats into MP3 the HTML5 player could play them.  The downloadable versions are in the original.mp3 format though.</p>

					<p>We borrowed our friend Frank Torres' drum machine on a few of these tracks, you can really tell the difference on those.  I think I programmed it most of the time because I used it to knock out a bass line, but Justin did some too.  In general, we started with the crappiest of equipment and found ways to come into better equipment over time.  You can really tell the varying quality of music for sure based on the quality of equipment we had on hand when the song was made.</p>

					<p>To Ben Gibbard, (since you'll never, ever see this now that you're all famous now) - sorry we didn't do a show with your band when you asked me... but really, it would have been embarrasing... you know... for you - didn't want to show you up, you know...  I wonder if you still have the tape you borrowed in 1993?  I *KNOW* you still have my old Fred and the Burkhardts tape, you thieveing bastard.</p>

					<p>Click a track below to show the player control for that track - or right click and Save As to download.  Only modern browers work on, I'm using the HTML5 audio standard as a player.  That means throwback browsers (like Internet Explorer 8 or older, for example) are out of luck.  You'll have to download each file manually.  The web has moved on - your browser hasn't...  sorry.  Oh, also, if you for some reason use Opera, you're also out of luck because it hasn't implemented MP3 in it's HTML5 audio element.  If you are having trouble, just go download the lastest version of Chrome and stop wasting time with crappy browsers.</p>

					<p>Note on the playlist system - it's not the smartest playback tool.  It plays each selected song, in the order you checked the boxes and plays the next song (defined by the order you picked them, NOT the name of the song) when the current one finishes.  You can skip to the next one by dragging the progress bar to the end of the song, but there's no way to go back to a previous song.  You can redo your playlist by unchecking all the boxes and checking them again in the order you want the songs to play. This is just here for convienience and really, this was a proof of concept application I wrote for something I was working on at work...  Also, you can add more songs to the end of the list on the fly by checking their boxes, but if you uncheck any boxes while the play process is underway, craziness may ensue.  You can clear your current list (it's listed over on the left) with the reset button.  If set up a list, you can save it to your browser's localStorage by clicking Save and then reload it by clicking Load.</p>

					<h3>Tristaline</h3>

					<p>This was the first of our "music"  - done as a birthday present for our friend Tristaline Hall</p>
					<p>Unfortunatly, I can't find that tape.  Hopefully it turns up!  It's packed so full of awesome, you might pee yourself.</p>

					<p><b>EDIT (08-05-2020)</b>:  I found it, but I'm not sure that's a good thing... Yet other punch to the face in 2020.  Still, it's where it all started, so here you go!</p>

I didn't spend much time with the Jocks, or the Gangbanger, or the Rockers, but I was friends with most of the Punks and Skaters, nearly all of whom were Straightedge Vegans, and tended to let you know it.  This song is a response to all that.</li>

Like I say, one take.  Still, from a musical perspective, this is probably the best put together song on this album.</li>

					<h3>interruption</h3>

					<p>We got a little crazy on this one.  We got access to the Olympic High School recording studio, so we have a couple high end keyboards, an 8-track recorder, and a mixer.  Much higher quality and sorta makes up for our overall lack of talent.  Also different here is that many of these tracks show me playing keyboards along with Justin.  This was done after I'd gone to college and was back home on summer break (hence the name "interruption", so a lot of the lyrics I wrote were influenced by people or experiences I was having my freshman year in college.</p>

					<p>* Not all of these were done in the studio, by the way...  you can tell the difference</p>

It's peppy and fun, but about how much of a jackass whoever it was I was pissed at was.  Makes me think of smiling at someone and slaping them in the face.  Also, no bass guitar, I was playing the bassline on the keyboard.</li>

One of my favorite song we did.  No bass on this one, I was playing the baseline keyboards, which Justin was singing and dealing with the other keyboard parts.</li>

I was playing guitar (was Josh's white fender strat I think) and Josh Doehne on my bass.  No keyboards on this one either.. very punk.</li>

						<li class="list-group-item"><input type="checkbox" class="playlist-selector"> <a class="track" href="https://www.mboxdrive.com/interruption-05-Spell.mp3" data-play="interruption-05-Spell.mp3">Spell</a> (Lyrics: Justin Rice)  Listening to this song, I'm reminded of how brutal I was to my poor fingers.

That and the fairly x-filesy keyboards give this song a very unique sound</li>

						<li class="list-group-item"><input type="checkbox" class="playlist-selector"> <a class="track recommended" href="https://www.mboxdrive.com/interruption-12-Take-the-Time.mp3" data-play="interruption-12-Take-the-Time.mp3">Take the Time</a> (Lyrics by: Justin Rice) This is, easily, the best song we ever did.  Josh Doehne was a guest producer on this one.  This was also, I think, the only song Justin and I actually wrote together (other than the Tristaline songs, that is), though the original lyrics were Justin's and the final lyrics we're substantially the same - but this one we took a lot more time tailoring lyrics and music to produce a track that had some good coherance, which didn't really happen before except by accident.  There was no bass on this one, I was playing the "bass" keyboard and that constant piston sound (no, that wasn't a digital loop, it was manually played in real-time.  digial looping... hahaha), Justin played the melody and sang.  I actually don't recall who dealt with the drums on this one, I think it was Justin.</li>
